                Working with children has been my passion since I was a child myself. From pretending to be the teacher to my stuffed animals, and babysitting the neighbors with candy bars as payment, I knew early on that my life would always be filled with children! Growing up in Auburn, much of my childhood was spent outdoors: catching snakes and bugs, playing in the river, and learning about birds alongside my bird obsessed mom. I feel grateful to have been raised by parents who instilled in us a love, appreciation, and respect for the natural world, and for giving us the time and space to develop our own personal connections to it.

                After several years studying architecture at the University of Colorado, Boulder, I was drawn back to my roots and settled into Truckee. I began teaching preschool and quickly knew that preschool was my “meant to be”. After two years teaching in Truckee, I moved to Park City, Utah. I was the nanny for a family with three amazing young boys for the next five years, while finishing my degree in Early Childhood Education at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. Los Angeles was my next adventure, where I taught preschool for two years, and was able to further develop a diverse knowledge of best-practices for my work with children. After several years in fast-paced LA, I was once again drawn back to Truckee. I worked as a nanny for several families here before deciding it was time to fulfill my life-long dream of starting my own school!
